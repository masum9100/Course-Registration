Question no.2 - Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

Answer- 

    I used total 5 state.


        -allCourses:
            allCourses is a state variable initialized as an empty array. This likely stores information about all available courses.

        -selectedCourse:
            selectedCourse is another state variable initialized as an empty array. This is likely used to store information about the courses that will be selected.

        -leftCredit:
            leftCredit is a state variable initialized with a value of 20 as sigma file. This could represent the remaining credit a user has available to use for selecting courses.

        totalCredit:
            totalCredit is a state variable initialized with a value of 0. This likely represents the total credit value of the courses selected by website visitor.

        -totalPrice and setTotalPrice:
            totalPrice is a state variable initialized with a value of 0. This will represent the total price of the courses selected by website visitor.
